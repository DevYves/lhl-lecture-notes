can be useful to label console log when you are just passing a function so you know where the function should be loggin.
example: console.log('Argv' , process.argv);

>console.log(diceNumber(process.argv[2]));


function obfuscateLetter(letter){
  switch (letter){
  case 'a': result '4';
  case 'e': return '3';
  case 'o': return '0';
  case 'l': return '1'

  default: return
 }
}

console.log(obfuscate(process.argv));


visual studio code - program to code with

functions
1) You cna create them on the fly
2) You can assign them to a data structure, like a variable or an array, or an object
3) You can pass a function to a function as an argument
4) You can return a function from a function.


Important things to remember with functions:
1) What does the function accept as arguments?
2) What does the function return?
3) How does the function change things?

if a function does not do 2 or 3 it is useless.
